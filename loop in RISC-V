Initial values: x5 = 0, x6 = 10

1. beq x6, x0, DONE   ; Branch if x6 is equal to zero
   (Not taken, as x6 is 10)

2. addi x6, x6, -1    ; Decrement x6 by 1
   (x6 = 9)

3. addi x5, x5, 2     ; Increment x5 by 2
   (x5 = 2)

4. jal x0, LOOP       ; Jump back to LOOP
   (Repeat steps 1-4)

... Repeat until x6 becomes zero ...

5. beq x6, x0, DONE   ; Branch if x6 is equal to zero
   (Taken, as x6 is now 0)

6. DONE:

Final values: x5 = 2 * 10 = 20
